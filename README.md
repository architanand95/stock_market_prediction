**Peregrine: High-Altitude Stock Market Insights**


**Description**
 Empowers High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) to make informed investment decisions by harnessing the power of data science and machine learning. It tackles two key challenges
 
  1. **Predicting Stock Closing Prices:** This system employs time series forecasting techniques to analyze historical stock data and generate predictions for future closing prices. 
  2. **Recommending Optimal Buy/Hold/Sell Strategies:** Based on the predicted prices and potentially other relevant financial indicators (to be specified in the Data section), the system suggests whether to buy, hold, or sell a particular stock on a given day, aiming to maximize potential profit for HNIs.

**Disclaimer**

It's crucial to emphasize that the stock market is inherently volatile and unpredictable. While this project strives to provide valuable insights, its predictions and recommendations should not be solely relied upon for investment decisions. Always conduct thorough research and consult with qualified financial advisors before making any investment moves.

**Dependencies**

* Python (version X.X or higher)  - Replace `X.X` with the specific version you're using
* Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
* NumPy (numerical computations)
* Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization) - Choose one or both based on your visualization needs
* Scikit-learn (machine learning library for time series forecasting) - Replace with the specific library you choose (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) if using deep learning

**Installation**

1. Ensure you have Python (version X.X or higher) installed on your system. You can check by running `python --version` in your terminal.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn  # Replace with your specific libraries
   ```

**Data**

This project requires historical stock price data for the target stocks. The specific data format will depend on the chosen data source. Here are some common options:

* Financial data providers (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) offer APIs or downloadable datasets.
* Public financial data repositories (e.g., Quandl, FRED)
  

**Future Work **

* Explore more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g., deep learning architectures like LSTMs or CNNs) for potentially improved prediction accuracy.
* Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., economic indicators, company news sentiment) to enhance the prediction and recommendation models.
* Develop an interactive user interface for easier prediction and recommendation access.
* Implement backtesting strategies to evaluate the historical performance of the model's recommendations.
